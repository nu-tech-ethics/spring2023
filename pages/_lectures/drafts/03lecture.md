A note on the Sandel book: the NU library does not have a copy of this book, so you will have to buy it. This will be the only book you have to buy in this class.

## Activities

### Activity 1: Cheatsheets
Create a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lHyFssnZBVTwwatslEH6O9NXrDteUz4IrMUxZCHzp1U/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">philosophy cheatsheet</a>.

1. Split up into groups of 3-5 people who read the same chapter you did (either Ch. 2, 3, or 5).
2. Make a copy of the Google Doc above (1 per group).
3. Everyone in the group: please put your name on the doc at the top.
4. Answer the questions as best you can (given that we'll only have 10-15 minutes to work on it).
5. When your done, make your doc permissions "anyone with the link can view" and email it to Sarah and Ayse.
6. We will share these documents on Canvas, to help each other understand some of the different moral perspectives.


### Activity 2: Analyze a Case study
