Today we have a packed agenda!
1. [Identity Journal](/fall2021/assignments/identity09)
1. Let's talk about <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Uf3MeX-eUIrsMBa1wo6zxDDP9D6U7vVqWloW9m63kcY/edit#heading=h.so2uixqxkzv6" target="_blank">the environment</a>.
1. [Computing Ethics & Society Working Group](/fall2021/working-group/).
1. [Project proposals](/fall2021/assignments/hw03-worksheet) (due Thursday). We have a few options here:
    * If folks are still deciding on a project idea / teams, we can do a brainstorming session (speed dating), where people share what they're interested and talk to one another.
    * If folks already have a sense of what they want to work on / who they would like to work with, we can use class time to discuss the worksheet / fill it out.
