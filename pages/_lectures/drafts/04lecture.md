Please discuss / document following <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PAYqzQBI4yr0ivzP0j6B8F4H3ZEE6vtidSuPe_IZEzM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">questions</a>.

1. Split up into groups of 3-5 people who read the same chapter you did (either Ch. 6 or 8).
2. Make a copy of the Google Doc above (1 per group).
3. Everyone in the group: please put your name on the doc at the top.
4. Answer the questions as best you can (given that we'll only have 10-15 minutes to work on it).
5. ***[different than Tuesday]*** When your done, we're asking that everyone in the group post a link to your group's Google doc to Canvas -- to streamline our attendance-taking process.
6. We will share these documents as a Canvas announcement, to help each other better understand Aristotle & Rawls.
