      title: The Internet

---

The internet is an enormous topic with many directions to explore. In this class, we're going to contine thinking about the idea of "democratization v. centralization" (carried over from [class 6](06lecture)).

## Discussion Questions

* How was the internet developed? 
* Who controls it?
* What were some of the early hopes for the internet in terms of its potential to positively impact society? 
    * Did these visions come true? Why or why not?
* What are some of the reasons that publishing and accessing web content has become more centralized (think of the technical infrastructure as well as the business models)?
* According to some of the experts we're hearing from today, what needs fixing? And how should we proceed in order 'fix the internet'?
