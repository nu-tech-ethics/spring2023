Using **at least 3** of the academic sources we have read so far, develop a conceptual framework that articulates your unique perspective on technology:
- Your conceptual framework should integrate theoretical arguments from the readings covered thus far and your own personal identity and experience in the world. 
- Ultimately, your conceptual framework should be useful, and productive. You will draw upon it to conduct a sociopolitical analysis of your technology. 
- Your analysis will be designed to shed light on questions such as: 
  - What values do this technology reflect, embrace, reject, or encourage? 
  - Who is affected by its design? How was its design affected by society? 
  - Who reaps the benefits, and who suffers the costs of its creation and use? 

Your paper should be 5-6 pages double spaced, 12-point font, Times New Roman. Follow [APA guidelines](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa6_style/index.html) for formatting and references.
