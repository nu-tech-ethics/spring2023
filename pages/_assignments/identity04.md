Massey argues that while all human societies divide people into categories, how resources are distributed across these categories can vary greatly (depending on the society). Massey then makes the argument (on pp. 1-4) that historically, technological developments have resulted in more stratification...but that public policy decisions (like the New Deal) can play an important role in reducing stratification. 

Considering some of the technologies in our current era (e.g. the Internet, ML, Big Data, AI, robots, and so forth): 

1. Have these technologies impacted how people are divided into categories (more categories, fewer categories, different category assignments)?
1. Have these technologies shaped how people in various social categories are viewed / represented in society? 
1. Have these technologies impacted how resources are distributed across social categories?
1. In your view, what forms of governance in 2021 would reduce stratification?

Answer one or more of the questions above, and try to tie this theme to an experience you've had or an observation you've made. Specific examples are always welcomed!
