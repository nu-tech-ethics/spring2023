## Setup (you'll only do this once)
1. Create a Google Document and title in the following way: “LASTNAME_FIRSTINITIAL_IDJ” (EX: “MELO_N_IDJ”)
  - This whole doc is your journal– a place to keep all entries together. 
  - You’ll be submitting individual entries through Canvas
2. Share Google Doc with profs: 
  - vcchavez@u.northwestern.edu
  - melon@u.northwestern.edu
3. Every time you make an entry, you must submit the text to Canvas 


## Let’s do the first entry!
Share your thoughts on the following:

1a. Why are you taking this course?

1b. How would you characterize your own relationship with technology?

2a. What do you need to thrive in this course (personally, intellectually, and socially)?

2b. What can you offer members of the course to thrive together (kind words, physical help, intellectual collaboration, and so on)?

2c. Anything else you think we should know!
