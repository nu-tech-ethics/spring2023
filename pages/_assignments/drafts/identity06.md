Benjamin argues on p. 111 that **“We do not all experience the dangers of exposure in equal measure.”** In other words, the benefits and harms of surveillance regimes are not evenly distributed.

* Think of all of the ways that your data / likeness / location / conversations are captured in the many systems, apps, cameras, surveillance systems that surround us all.
* Then, think of an example of how any of these systems and the data they collect might (a) help you and/or (b) hurt you.
* How might experiences of benefit and harm differ for someone belonging to a more vulnerable social category?
