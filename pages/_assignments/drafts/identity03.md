Consider the following quote from Benjamin:

{:.blockquote-no-margin}
> “...the desire for objectivity, efficiency, profitability, and progress fuels the pursuit of technical fixes across many different social arenas” (p. 7)

Given three of the values named above -- objectivity, efficiency, and progress -- pick one and define it in your own words. Then, think of an example of a technical fix was pursued in the name of objectivity/efficiency/progress (whichever value you chose) that ended up under/devaluing something else -- something that was perhaps even more important. Tell us about it.

When you're done, paste your response from the Google Doc into the <a href="https://canvas.northwestern.edu/courses/149914/assignments/965499">Canvas Assignment</a>.
