For Thursday's class, we will be discussing the Facebook files with <a href="https://www.wsj.com/news/author/deepa-seetharaman" target="_blank">Deepa Seetheraman</a>. These readings are assigned [here](../12lecture). She has asked, specifically, that you review the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-documents-instagram-teens-11632953840?mod=article_inline" target="_blank">underlying documents</a> that informed the second story on teens and research.

On <a href="https://canvas.northwestern.edu/courses/149914/discussion_topics/1018180" target="_blank">Canvas</a>, please answer any of the following questions:

* What are some of your reactions to the Facebook documents?
* What are the ethical obligations of a platform to society? 
* What kinds of regulatory measures do Maréchal & Roberts propose to curb some of the more problematic aspects of social media?
* What do Maréchal & Roberts argue that content moderation alone not enough?

When you're done, you will respond to at least two of your classmates’ posts.

Shoot for around 200-400 words in length (give or take).
