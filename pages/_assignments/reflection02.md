On Canvas, please respond to [today's readings](../lectures/04lecture) (Ch. 6, 8, & 9 of Sandel). As stated in the syllabus, responses should be around 200-400 words in length (give or take), and your grade will be based on evidence that you did the readings. Some approaches that you could take include (but are not limited to):

* Summarizing one or more key arguments and whether / how these arguments resonate with you.
* Analyzing some of the strengths or weaknesses of the article(s).
* Writing about an idea you were confused about and/or didn’t entirely understand (and what about them was confusing / ambiguous).
* Sharing thoughts about how the readings connect to other readings we’ve done, to current events going on in the world, or to an experience that you've had.
* Sharing thoughts on what you would like to learn about in more detail.

When you're done, you will respond to at least two of your classmates’ posts.
