## Instructions
In your first homework assignment, you will be analyzing a technology-related controversy that has made the headlines recently, using some of the philosophical ideas that we've been learning about. Please complete the 4 tasks below:

### 1. Describe the controversy (~1/3 page single spaced) 
Describe the technology, the controversy, and the context surrounding the controversy. Make sure you answer the following questions:

* What is the debate?
* Why is it a debate?
* Who are the stakeholders in the debate?

### 2. Analyze the controversy (between 2/3 and 1 page single spaced) 
Analyze the controversy using one or more of the philosophical texts we have been reading in this class. Some approaches you might take:

* Consider how Pinker, Haidt, or Singer might make analyze the context, using some of the terms and concepts from their work.
* Describe how one or more philosophical approaches (e.g. utilitarianism, libertarianism, Kantian / deontological ethics, virtue ethics, Rawls, etc.) would make sense of the controversy and settle the debate.
* You are also welcome to take another analytic approach, so long as it is grounded in the readings and ideas of the class thus far.

#### Some guidelines for part 2:

* Be sure to define the theories / philosophical approaches that you draw upon (with citations from the course readings) before applying them to the controversy you selected.
* You don't have to agree with the philosophical approach you have selected. The task here is to practice ***applying*** a framework to a real-world problem.

### 3. Describe how YOU think the controversy should be resolved (~1/3 page single spaced) 

* Describe what you think is the right and just thing to do. Why do you think this?
* Given your assessment, explain which philosophical perspective(s) you most align with and why.

### 4. Three Slide Summary
Create a very short, 3-slide summary of your analysis using Google Slides, PowerPoint, etc., and be prepared to present and talk about your analysis to your classmates on Tuesday (10/12). One slide will describe the controversy, one slide will describe your analysis, and one slide will describe your own perspectives. Feel free to communicate these ideas any way that you want (text, images, etc.). 

## Paper Format, References, & Citation Guidelines
* When describing the controversy, please reference at least three different news sources / think pieces (e.g. newspaper articles, blogs, online magazines, etc.) related to your debate. When possible, these sources will characterize the debate from multiple angles.
* Please cite your sources as you describe the controversy and characterize the philosophical approaches, following APA guidelines for formatting and references. 
* Your HW1 format may be in essay form or you may list out the three questions and respond to each of them -- up to you.
