For people in the class who are interested in continuing to think about / work on projects with a social or ethical focus, we are planning to host a tech ethics working group, next winter and spring, that can be taken for credit.

## What are the goals of the working group?
* To nurture a community of technologists who are interested in working to create tools, processes, systems, educational resources, etc. that explore or address ethical issues in tech.
* To consider the ethics of the design process by putting CS396 ideas into practice.
* To continue ongoing discussions / debates involving the ethics and politics of tech.

## How do I join?
To join the working group, you must:
* Have already taken CS396 (Computing, Ethics, & Society)
* Be nominated by Aysé, Sarah, Natalie, and/or Sepehr based on your final project submission and expressed interest.
* Be able to commit to the independent study.

## What are the expectations / commitments of the group?
* Commitment from beginning of winter quarter until end of spring quarter (20 weeks total).
* 1.5 hr/week meeting with other teams, can enroll in independent study with Sarah for credit (winter quarter required, spring quarter optional) 
    * Meetings will be a time to reflect on current progress and issues that arise when designing and implementing projects.
* Writing in Identity Journal
* Turn in a final version of the project proposed within CS396 final project proposal.
    * Totally OK if implementation changes throughout the course of the year!
* Presenting your work at a CS Ethics Conference in the Spring

## Assessment
* You deliverable must demonstrate that you engaged deeply with a topic /concept related to the class
* You deliverable must demonstrate that you worked genuinely with a real stakeholders / community groups throughout the process.
* You deliverable must demonstrate that you have put your knowledge in action to create a meaningful change.

Note that we use the term "deliverable" to make the format open-ended and inclusive of a wide variety of different approaches: artwork, graphic novels, storybooks, videos, and more. Have fun with this and express yourself in the format most comfortable for you.

<!-- ## What will working groups learn throughout the winter/spring?
* **Looking In:** What does it mean to be a reflexive designer, and to be responsible and supportive of your team?
* **Looking Out:** How can you anticipate consequences? Meaningfully engage with stakeholders? Make your deliverable accessible? Sustainable?
* **Looking Toward:** Impact, Flexible Design Approaches, Communicating the “So What?” -->

## CS Ethics Conference
In the Spring, working group participants will present their final projects as part of a CS Ethics Conference, hosted at Nortwestern. There, they will discuss their deliverables, share lessons learned, brainstorm potential next steps, etc. with fellow students and stakeholders. 

## Other Ideas
* Depending on projects, can work at the Garage (which has a prototyping lab, staff resources, etc); could maybe have an interesting conversation about neoliberalism’s effects on design. 
* Once a quarter coming to TREE lab meetings and present -- for feedback, support, and accountability.
* Let's keep adding to this list!
